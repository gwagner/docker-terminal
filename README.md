# docker-terminal

Use docker as your normal every day terminal.  Take your specific config from machine to machine without needing 
to do any of the symlinking magic most people do to ensure settings are move.  Startup a terminal in a container, when done exit.  
Forget to exit?  Your container will be cleaned up in 6 hours.  Need your terminal back, no worries, you can always `docker attach`
back to the running container.

# Is this needed?

Probably not, just a fun experiment!!
